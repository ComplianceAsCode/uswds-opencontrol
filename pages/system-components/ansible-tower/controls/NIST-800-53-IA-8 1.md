##Acceptance Of Piv Credentials From Other Agencies
#### Description
"The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials from other federal agencies."
#### Ansible Tower
'Personal Identity Verificiation (PIV) credentials are those
credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication
201 and supporting guidance documents. Customers will not be expected
to perform this credential verification for government agencies. A
mechanism for allowing government agencies to perform credential
verification in a way that can be trusted by the customer system is
through Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) or Red Hat IdM.

Documentation on satisfying this control is being tracked on
