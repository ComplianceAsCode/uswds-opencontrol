##Permitted Actions Without Identification Or Authentication
#### Description
"The organization:
  a.  Identifies [Assignment: organization-defined user actions] that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational missions/business functions; and
  b.  Documents and provides supporting rationale in the security plan for the information system, user actions not requiring identification or authentication."
#### Ansible Tower
'Regardless of access mechanism, such as the Ansible Tower
console, unauthenticated users will only be shown the
system use notifications (as defined in AC-8) and login prompt. This is
non-configurable behavior.

External service APIs also require authentication
prior to granting resource access.'
