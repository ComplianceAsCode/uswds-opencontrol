#NIST-800-53-AC-7
##Unsuccessful Logon Attempts
#### Description
"The information system:
  a.  Enforces a limit of [Assignment: organization-defined number] consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; and
  b.  Automatically [Selection: locks the account/node for an [Assignment: organization-defined time period]; locks the account/node until released by an administrator; delays next logon prompt according to [Assignment: organization-defined delay algorithm]] when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded."
#### Ansible Tower

##### a
'Ansible Tower does not currently have the capability to enforce limits
on consecutive logon attempts.

To satisfy this control an external authentication service, such
as Red Hat IdM, must be used. This control is not applicable to
Ansible Tower when an external authentication service is used.'


##### b
'Ansible Tower does not currently have the capability automatically
lock an account for an organizationally-defined time period, nor
does Ansible Tower have the capability to lock an account until
released by an administrator.

To satisfy those elemenets of this control an external
authentication service, such as Red Hat IdM, must be used.
Those two elements of this control are not applicable to
Ansible Tower when an external authentication service
is used.

Ansible Tower does not currently have the ability to delay
logon prompts according to an organizationally-defined delay
algorithm when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is
exceeded. Ansible Tower cannot be configured to perform
this functionality; delay of further logon prompts is a permanent
finding.'
