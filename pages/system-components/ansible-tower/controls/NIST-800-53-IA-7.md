##Cryptographic Module Authentication
#### Description
"The information system implements mechanisms for authentication to a cryptographic module that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance for such authentication."
#### Ansible Tower
'The customer will be responsible for configuring Ansible Tower to use
appropriate cryptographic modules. A successful control response will
document what modules are in use, how to attest the configuration is
in place, and references to supporing documentation outlining the
FIPS 140-2 certification for enabled modules.

Documentation to satisfy this control is being tracked on GitHub:
