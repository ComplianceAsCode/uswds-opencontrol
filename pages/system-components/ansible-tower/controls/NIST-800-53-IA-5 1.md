#NIST-800-53-IA-5 1
##Password-Based Authentication
#### Description
"The information system, for password-based authentication:
   (1)(a).  Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined requirements for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type];
   (1)(b).  Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are created: [Assignment: organization-defined number];
   (1)(c).  Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords;
   (1)(d).  Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment: organization-defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum];
   (1)(e).  Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number] generations; and
   (1)(f).  Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password."
#### Ansible Tower

##### a
'Ansible Tower does not have the capability to enforce minimum
password complexity requirements.

To satisfy this control an external authentication service, such
as Red Hat IdM, must be used. This control is not applicable to
Ansible Tower when an external authentication service is used.'


##### b
'Ansible Tower does not have the capability to enforce at least
an organizationally-defined number of characters be changed
when new passwords are created.

To satisfy this control an external authentication service, such
as Red Hat IdM, must be used. This control is not applicable to
Ansible Tower when an external authentication service is used.'


##### c
'If passwords are used, Ansible Tower handles those by responding
directly to the password prompt and decrypting the password before
writing it to the prompt.

The encryption/decryption algorithm uses a variation of Fernet: a
symmetric encryption cipher utilizing AES-256 in CBC mode alongside
a SHA-256 HMAC. Specific, sensitive, Model fields in Tower are
encrypted and include:

CREDENTIAL
  - password
  - ssh_key_data
  - ssh_key_unlock
  - become_password
  - vault_password

UNIFIED JOB:
  - start_args

Data is encrypted before it is saved to the database and it is
decrypted as needed in Tower. The encryption/decryption process
derives the AES-256 bit encryption key from
<SECRET_KEY, field_name, primary_key> where field_name is the
field_name of the Model field and primary_key is the database assigned
auto-incremented record ID. Thus, if any attribute used in the key
generation process changes, Tower fails to correctly decrypt the
secret.'


##### d
'Ansible Tower does not have the capability to enforce password
minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions.

To satisfy this control an external authentication service, such
as Red Hat IdM, must be used. This control is not applicable to
Ansible Tower when an external authentication service is used.'


##### e
'Ansible Tower does not have the capability prohibit password
reuse.

To satisfy this control an external authentication service, such
as Red Hat IdM, must be used. This control is not applicable to
Ansible Tower when an external authentication service is used.'


##### f
'Ansible Tower does not have the capability allow the use of a
temporary password for system logons with an immediate change
to a permanent password.

To satisfy this control an external authentication service, such
as Red Hat IdM, must be used. This control is not applicable to
Ansible Tower when an external authentication service is used.'
