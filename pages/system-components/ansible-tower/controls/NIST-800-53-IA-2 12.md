##Acceptance Of Piv Credentials
#### Description
"The information system accepts and electronically verifies Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials."
#### Ansible Tower
'Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials are those credentials
issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and
supporting guidance documents. Customers will not be expected to perform
this credential verification for government agencies. A mechanism for
allowing government agencies to perform credential verification in a way
that can be trusted by the customer system is through Active Directory
Federation Services (ADFS).

Documentation/guidance for this control is being tracked on GitHub:
