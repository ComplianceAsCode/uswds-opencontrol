#NIST-800-53-IA-8
##Identification And Authentication (Non-Organizational Users)
#### Description
"The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates non-organizational users (or processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users)."
#### Ansible Tower
'Ansible Tower does not have the capability to uniquely
identify and authenticate non-organizational users (or
processes acting on behalf of non-organizational users).

To satisfy this control an external authentication service, such
as Red Hat IdM, must be used. This control is not applicable to
Ansible Tower when an external authentication service is used.'
