#### Ansible Tower

##### a
'As a procedural control, the process of backing up Ansible Tower
is outside the scope of a configuration guide.

The customer will be responsible for conducting daily incremental and
weekly full backups of user-level information contained in the
information system. Additional FedRAMP requirements and guidance include
maintaining at least three backup copies of user-level information (at
least one of which is available online) or provides an equivalent
alternative. A successful control response will detail how backups of
user-level information occures, and how three backup copies are
maintained.

Documentation on backing up and restoring Ansible Tower data
can be found in the Ansible Tower Administration guide:

'As a procedural control, the process of backing up Ansible Tower
is outside the scope of a configuration guide.

The customer will be responsible for protecting the confidentiality,
integrity, and available of backup information at storage locations.
Additional FedRAMP requirements and guidance include determining
what elements of the cloud environment require the Information System
Backup control. The customer will determine how Information System
Backup is going to be verified and appropriate periodicity of the
check.
