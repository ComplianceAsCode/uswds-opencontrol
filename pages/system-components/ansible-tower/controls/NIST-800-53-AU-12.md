##Audit Generation
#### Description
"The information system:
  a.  Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components];
  b.  Allows [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the information system; and
  c.  Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2 d. with the content defined in AU-3."
#### Ansible Tower

##### a
'By default, Ansible Tower audits the following events.
Audit of these events is automatic and not user configurable.

- Audit User & Group Management Events,
User modify (Success and Failure)
- Audit User & Group Management Events,
User add (Success and Failure)
- Audit User & Group Management Events,
User delete (Success and Failure)
- Audit User & Group Management Events,
Group/Role add (Success and Failure)
- Audit User & Group Management Events,
Group/Role delete (Success and Failure)
- Audit User & Group Management Events,
Group/Role modify (Success and Failure)


The following BugZillas track feature creation for Ansible Tower
to audit certain events:

- Audit Logons (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/345

- Audit Logoff (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/346

- Audit File & Object Creation (Success and Failure):

- Audit File & Object Access (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/348

- Audit File & Object Deletion (Success and Failure)

- Audit File & Object Modification (Success and Failure)

- Audit File & Object Permission Changes (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/351

- Audit File & Object Ownership Modifications (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/352

- Audit User & Group Management Events, User suspend (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/451

- Audit User & Group Management Events, User lock (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/452

- Audit Use of Privileged/Special Rights, security or policy changes (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/456

- Audit Use of Privileged/Special Rights, configuration changes (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/457

- Audit Use of Privileged/Special Rights, Admin or root-level access (Success and Failure):
- Audit Privilege/Role Escalation (Success and Failure):

- Audit and Log Data Access (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/460

- Export of Information (Success and Failure):
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/redhat/issues/461

- Import of Information (Success and Failure):

Certain events, such as updating Projects, may pull data
from a SCM. In such cases the audit event includes the content
defined in AU-3 as well as the URL if the information being imported.

A sample audit event for updating a "Demo Project" with content from
GitHub is below. The "scm_url" field reflects source of information
being imported and "status" field indicates succes or failure:
