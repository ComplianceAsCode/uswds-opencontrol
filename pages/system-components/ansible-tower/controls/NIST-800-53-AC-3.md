##Access Enforcement
#### Description
"The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information           and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies."
#### Ansible Tower
'There are three types of Tower users that can be assigned:

- Normal User
Normal Users have read and write access limited to the resources
(such as inventory, projects, and job templates) for which that user
has been granted the appropriate roles and privileges.

- System Auditor
Auditors implicitly inherit the read-only capability for all objects
within the Tower environment.

- System Adminisrator
A Tower System Administrator (also known as a Superuser) has admin,
read, and write privileges over the entire Tower installation. A
System Administrator is typically responsible for managing all
aspects of Tower and delegating responsibilities for day-to-day
work to various Users.

Ansible Tower uses role-based access control to provide the ability
to read, modify, and administer projects, inventories, job templates,
and other Ansible Tower elements. The role-based access control policies
can be defined per-user, or per user type as indicated above.
