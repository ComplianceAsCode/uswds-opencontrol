##Acceptance Of Third-Party Credentials
#### Description
"The information system accepts only FICAM-approved third-party credentials."
#### Ansible Tower
'FICAM approved credentials are those credentials issued by nonfederal
government entities approved by the Federal Identity, Credential, and
Access Management (FICAM) Trust Framework Solutions Initiative.
Customers iwill not be expected to perform credential veritification for
government agencies. A mechanism for allowing government agencies to
perform credential verification in a way that can be trusted by the
customer system is through Active Directory Federation Services
(ADFS) or Red Hat IdM.
