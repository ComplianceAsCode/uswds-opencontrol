##Protection Of Audit Information
#### Description
"The information system protects audit information and audit tools from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion."
#### Ansible Tower
'Ansible Tower logfiles have been consolidated and can be easily
accessed from two centralized locations:

- /var/log/tower/
- /var/log/supervisor/

Each directory is protected by operating system-level
mandatory access control settings and require administrative (root)
privilege to access.

The ability to protect embedded log data, such as those
included in the Ansible Tower Activity Stream, is being
tracked on GitHub:
